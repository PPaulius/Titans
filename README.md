This Flask web application includes an About page about a gaming clan and its main members, built with Django. Users can learn about the clan's history, mission, and values, as well as view profiles of its key members. Additionally, the website features a Careers page with embedded links to video reviews of professions relevant to the clan. The Contact page allows users to submit inquiries via a form. The website utilizes a SQLite database to store contact form submissions and provides a basic user interface. The floating label feature was implemented using JavaScript, and the visual design and styling were achieved using the Bootstrap, jQuery, and Font-Awesome libraries.
